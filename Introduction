In this project, I demonstrate my ability to analyze network traffic using Wireshark, a powerful network protocol analyzer. The project focuses on capturing live traffic, analyzing different protocols, and identifying potential security issues within the captured data. The goal is to showcase my skills in network analysis and cybersecurity, specifically how I can use Wireshark to investigate and interpret network traffic. This project includes detailed documentation, example capture files, and a comprehensive analysis report, making it a valuable addition to my cybersecurity portfolio.
